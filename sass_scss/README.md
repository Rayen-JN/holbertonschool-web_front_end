# SASS & SCSS: An Introduction

Welcome to the **SASS & SCSS** repository! This repo provides a basic overview and examples of **SASS (Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets)** and **SCSS (Sassy CSS)**, two popular CSS preprocessors that make writing and maintaining stylesheets more efficient.

## What is SASS & SCSS?

**SASS** and **SCSS** are extensions of CSS that add power and elegance to the basic language. They allow the use of variables, nested rules, inline imports, and more, making CSS more dynamic and maintainable.

- **SASS** uses indentation instead of brackets and semicolons.
- **SCSS** is a more CSS-friendly syntax and uses brackets and semicolons, much like regular CSS.

Both file types are compiled down to regular CSS that browsers can understand.
